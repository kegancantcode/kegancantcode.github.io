You say you like the wind blowing through your hair
Come on, roll with me 'til the sun goes down
Texas sun
Say you wanna hit the highway while the engine roars
Well, come on, roll with me 'til the sun goes down
That Texas sun, oh yeah
That Texas sun
Caressing you from Fort Worth to Amarillo
Come on, roll with me 'til the sun dips low
That Texas sun
That Texas sun, oh girl
That Texas sun
When I'm far from home and them cold winds blow
Stuck out somewhere with folks I don't know
'Cause you keep me and nice and you keep me warm
Wanna feel you on me, can't wait to get back there again
That Texas sun
That Texas sun
That Texas sun, oh
That Texas sun
You say you like the wind blowing through your hair
Well, come on, roll with me 'til the sun goes down
That Texas sun
That Texas sun
Ooh baby, you're so gorgeous
How about you and me take a lil' trip
In the big body?
Take a ride with me, babe
You by my side
How does it sound?
You and I
Oh, girl
Take a ride with me, babe
You by my side
How does it sound?
You and I
Baby, oh
Take a ride with me, babe
You by my side
How does it sound?
You and I
